## What problem does this solve?

A clear and concise description of what problem this feature would solve. For example:

- needing to type out the full flag name takes a long time, so I would like to suggest adding auto-complete
- I use (osx, windows, linux) and would like support for (some existing feature) to be extended to my platform
- the terminal output for a particular error case is confusing, and I think it could be improved
