There are a small set of breaking changes between v1 and v3.  Converting is
relatively straightforward and typically takes less than an hour. Specific steps
are included in [Migration Guide: v1 to v3](../migrate-v1-to-v3.md). Also see
the [pkg.go.dev docs](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/urfave/cli/v3) for v3 API
documentation.
